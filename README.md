## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### Continued development

If I continued developing this solution, I would resolve an issue with responsiveness that I noticed. When going from desktop -> mobile -> desktop, the second desktop layout can be different than how it originally looked. I would like to spend more time investigating what causes this and determine how to avoid it in the future.
